This is a modified huffman algorithm implemented in java programming language.
It has following features:
    1:Read the data from file original.txt. <br/>
    2:Calculate the size of the file original.txt in bits.<br/>
  	3:Tells How many unique characters are there in file original.txt.<br/>
    4:Print the Frequency table(characters and their frequencies) for the file original.<br/>
  	5:Print the Huffman Tree for the file original.<br/>
  	6:Print the Huffman Table(characters and their corressponding enconding) for the file original.<br/>
  	7:Encoding of each character in separate file encoded.<br/>
    8:Print the size of the file encoded.txt in bits.<br/>
    9:Reconstruct the original file by the name of reconstructed.txt.<br/>
    10:Print report that tells us whether the file original.txt and the file reconstructed.txt are same.<br/>
